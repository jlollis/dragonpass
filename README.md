## DragonPass

A Simple Password Generator, written in Racket

Follows the XKCD method to create secure, easy to remember passwords. (I'd personally only recommend that for temporary passwords.)

It is very simple, yes. The most interesting thing about this project is that it is built wholly in Racket, using Racket's built-in webserver capabilities. The password generation script is also in Racket. 

This is just a little project to see what could be done in Racket.
