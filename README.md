## DragonPass

A Simple Password Generator, written in Racket


Follows the XKCD method to creating secure, easy to remember passwords.


I started this project to accomplish two goals:
1. to create a sysadmin/IT support tool for creating temporary accounts for password resets, which could be easily remembered and/or given over the phone. 
2. to build something fun with Racket webserver. (This proved to be a bit more challenging than originally expected.)
